Step 1: created new rails project using command:    rails new webhook_app
go to current created project use command:        cd webhook_app


Step 2: Create a new model with validations
rails generate model Data name:string data:text


step 3: migrate the database to create the necessary table:  rake db:migrate

Step 4:  Add validation in model file

step 5:  generate a new controller called "DataController"

rails generate controller Data create update


skip_before_action:    The filter is added to Controller . create and update actions will work as before without requiring the user to be logged in. 

Step 4: Configure third-party API endpoints
In the config/application.rb file, add the line within the class Application < Rails::Application block

config.third_party_endpoints = ['https://api.example.com/endpoint1', 'https://api.example.com/endpoint2']


Step 5: Verify webhook request authenticity
In the notify_third_party_apis method under controller, the webhook request authenticity can be verified by including an X-Webhook-Secret header with a secret key. You can replace 'your_secret_key' with the actual secret key that the third parties will use to verify the authenticity of the webhook request.
